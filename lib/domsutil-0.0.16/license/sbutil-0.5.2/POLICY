Distribution and Hacking Policies fo sbutil
===========================================

VERSIONING
 Versions are numbered "major.minor.micro". When ever
 the minor version changes, a CVS branch will be created.
 Code going into a micro-release is commited to this branch.
 The naming of this branch will be release-<major>-<minior>.
 
 Ie. to check out the 1.2 release do
 
    cvs co sbutil -r release-1-2

API-STABILITY

 - Stable API on major version numbers
 
 - Adding API is not considered and API change,
   adding api requires a bump in the minor version
 
 - Bug fixes only change the micro version
  
 - THERE ARE NO GUARANTEE ON THE API OF THE CVS CODE
   only actual releases have any api guarantees

HACKING AND CVS
 Any CVS commits must be signed off by one of the
 people listed in MAINTAINERS.
 
 Any cvs commit must be accompanied by a proper message.
 A changelog will be autogenerated from the cvs commit messages
 when a release is made.
